## Abstract
This project presents an optimized 8-bit Content Addressable Memory (CAM) design, leveraging the advantages of 9-Transistor (9T) Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cells. Traditional CAMs, with their parallel search capability, are effective in high-speed applications but suffer from high power consumption. The 9T SRAM cell improves upon these aspects, offering enhanced stability and low-power operation. Our novel 8-bit CAM design incorporates the 9T SRAM structure for better read stability and write ability, crucial for high-speed search operations. The full-custom design approach further optimizes layout and performance parameters. Simulation results confirm improved speed, reduced power consumption, and increased stability over traditional CAM designs. This study establishes a pathway toward efficient, low-power, and high-speed CAMs, suitable for data routing and lookup applications.
